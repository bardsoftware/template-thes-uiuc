University of Illinois Thesis Template

uiucthesis is a LaTeX package for formatting theses in the format
required by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

A class file and style file are provided. Both provide identical
functionality except that the class file loads the "book"
class with the [oneside] option.

The Graduate College changes thesis formatting requirements from time to time; as far as we know, these files conform to Fall 2009 requirements. However, be sure to consult the current version of the Graduate College Handbook.

The 2009 version of the template was prepared by a student who is himself in the process of writing his phd thesis and graduating. This template has thus not been validated in any way by the graduate college. There is still no indication that a thesis prepared with this template has been received and accepted by the graduate college. The student who wrote this package can make no guarantee that this template will comply to the current rules of the graduate college. This student is also busy, so support may be hit or miss until he graduates.

The 2007 version of the template was prepared by Tim Head, based on prior templates by Peter Czoschke and David Hull.

uiucthesis is a LaTeX package for formatting theses in the format required by the University of Illinois, effective Fall 2007.
